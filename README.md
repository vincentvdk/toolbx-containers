# Toolbx containers
Source to build `toolbox` container images containing all tools and config that I use on a daily basis.

⚠️⚠️ __DISCLAIMER__: This project is still in flux and should be used at your own risk ⚠️⚠️

![toolbox](https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/844/934/png-transparent-car-icon-toolbox-miscellaneous-brown-text-thumbnail.png)

this project currently has 2 images:

- base-toolbox toolbox (general purpose toolbox)
- vim-toolbox (uses base-toolbox as a base + neovim)

## Motivation
I work as a freelance Cloud Engineer / SRE and often need seperate environments
for different customers. Sometimes I even need different environments for
multiple teams at a single customer.

## Requirements
These toolboxes are based on Fedora as I run them on Fedora Silverblue. They are not tested on
other distributions.

- To run the toolboxes you need at least `toolbox` installed (https://containertoolbx.org/).
- If you need to build the toolbox images you also need `podman` (https://podman.io/ which is a dependency of toolbox) 

## What's in the toolboxes?
### Packages
- tmux
- asdf

### NeoVim
- Plugins are managed by `Packer` which seems to be the go-to plugin manager for Neovim.
- Language server (LSP) is handled by `neovim-lsp`.
- `Telescope` takes care of fuzzy finding.

#### efm-langserver
efm is a General Purpose Language server and is used to format/lint using the build in LSP.
[https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver](https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver)
```
go install github.com/mattn/efm-langserver@latest
````

### Theme
I use the [Nightfox](https://github.com/EdenEast/nightfox.nvim) theme.

## How to use the toolbox
### Build container images
From the root of this project run:
```
podman build -t toolbox/nvim nvim-toolbox/
```

### Create and run a toolbox using the container image
Create a toolbox with the name `mytoolbox`
```
$ toolbox create -i toolbox/nvim mytoolbox
Created container: mytoolbox
Enter with: toolbox enter mytoolbox
```

Run the toolbox
```
toolbox enter mytoolbox
```

I always use `tmux` for work in a terminal. Since it's part of the container
image you can run it from the toolbox. But you can also get a `tmux` session in one go

```
toolbox run -c mytoolbox tmux
```


## How secrets are managed
<TBD>


## How binaries are managed.
A lot of the tools that I use can be installed by downloading a binary, make it
executable and add it to a location in $PATH. Example: Terraform, kubectl,
golang, ...

Adding all these to the container image would cause it to become quite big
which is something I want to prevent. therefore the useful
[asdf]([https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) tool will be used. This tool will
install and manage the versions for the binaries we need, but will put them on
the host system (so not in the container - `$ASDF_DATA_DIR`).

Best way to explain it is by showing some examples

### Example: Install golang
```
asdf plugin add golang
asdf install golang 1.19.1
asdf global golang 1.19.1
asdf current golang
```
Check the `asdf` [documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) (run asdf without options to get options)

## Dependencies
The following packages are needed for NeoVim plugins (Treesitter)

```
dnf install gcc clang
```

## Troubleshooting
Issue: When opening help in NeoVim you see the following error: `cannot find -lstdc++: No such file or directory`
Solution: install `gcc clang lstdc++-static lstdc++` and run in vim `:TSUpdate`

__NOTE__: It is a good idea to run `TSUpdate` after an update of `TreeSitter`
